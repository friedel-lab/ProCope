<h2>ProCope
Java API</h2>
<br>
This is an introduction to the Java Library and its API provided by
ProCope. All functionality can be embedded in your own Java
applications by linking the ProCope JAR file in the classpath and
then
accessing the respective classes. A detailed documentation of all
classes and methods can be found in the <a href="../javadoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a>
of&nbsp;ProCope. This page provides an introduction to the main functionality along with a set of well-documented <span style="font-weight: bold;">sample&nbsp;use cases</span>
which guide you step-by-step throught most of the functionality in the
library.<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Classpath</span><br>
</h3>
In order to use the ProCope classes in your project, be sure to include one of
the <code>.jar</code> file delivered with the download package in your Java
classpath. <code>ProCope_core-X.Y.jar</code> (where <code>X.Y</code>
is the current version) is needed for the main ProCope functionality.
When creating diagrams and histograms or sequence alignments, you will also need the
<a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/" target="_blank">JFreeChart</a> and <a href="http://jaligner.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">JAligner</a> libraries. These are fully included in <code>ProCope-X.Y.jar</code>.

<h3>Extensibility<br>
</h3>
Note that you can integrate your own clusterers and scores calculators
into the graphical user interface and the command line tools of
ProCope. See also: <a target="_parent" href="../main/index_userdef.html">User defined classes</a><br>
<h3>The protein manager</h3>
Introduction and example codes on the handling of protein identifiers in the ProCope library.&nbsp; <a href="protmanage.html">Show protein manager documentation<br>
</a><br>
Note: As the protein manager is an essential part of the library, its
basic usage is also covered by the example use cases (see above).<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interologs</span><br>
<br>
ProCope contains some methods to transfer protein protein interactions
using homology information. If you are interested in these features,
read the <a href="../javadoc/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a> of the <code>procope.methods.interologs</code> package. Feel free to contact me via email for further information and help.<br>
