<h2>Interologs<br>
</h2>
ProCope contains a set of methods to calculate and score <span style="font-style: italic;">interologs</span>.
&nbsp;The basic assumption for this type of interaction is that
homologs of interacting proteins have a high probability of being
interaction partners as well. These homology-derived potential
interactors are then called interologs. The methods implemented in
ProCope are taken from a publication by <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15173116" target="_blank">Yu et al., 2004</a>.<br>
<br>
To calculate interologs, a given protein interaction network and a
protein mapping (usually homology information) is used as input. The
protein mapping is represented as a directed network where each
directed edge represents one protein/protein mapping. Protein
interactions are mapped and the resulting transferred interactions
scored using the original BLAST evalues or pairwise alignment scores of
the homologs.<br>
<br>
The GUI and command line of ProCope do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> include
interolog calculation. Check out the JavaDocs of the <code>procope.methods.interologs</code>
package to find out how to access the methods programatically.
